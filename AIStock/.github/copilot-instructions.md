This project is a modern web app called AIStock for sharing AI-generated art. Only the admin can upload images. The site has a landing page, a gallery of images, and a clear notice that images are NOT for full commercial use. The stack is Vite + React + TypeScript, with a Node.js/Express backend for uploads (to be added).
